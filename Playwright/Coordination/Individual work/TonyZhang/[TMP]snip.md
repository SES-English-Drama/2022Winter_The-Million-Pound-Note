## Act 5. Henry got to know Locke and they became good friends.

### Scene 1. Hotel receptionist leads Adams into the lobby, while Locke is signing his name at the counter, with hotel manager standing beside him.

Actors: Henry Adams, Receptionist, Manager, Locke, Narrator

Receptionist: <font color=grey>*(To Henry Adams)*</font> Welcome to Bumbles. The manager is expecting you. <font color=grey>*(To manager)*</font> This is Mr. Henry Adams.

Manager: Adams? Did you say Adams!

Henry Adams: That’s right.

Manager: <font color=grey>*(Awkwardly)*</font> Oh, Mr. Adams, I am awfully sorry. There’s been the most unfortunate misunderstanding. Sign your name on the register, please.

Henry Adams: What’s going on?

Narrator: The hotel staff has mistaken Locke, a dumb man with shocking strength, for Adams. Locke was reluctant to leave, and the hotel staff decides to call the police.

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Frowns, glares at Manager aggressively)*</font>

Receptionist: <font color=grey>*(Leads Locke away)*</font>

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Knocks receptionist down)*</font>

Henry Adams: Just a minute. I don’t think we need the police. I’d like to have a talk with this gentleman. <font color=grey>*(Walks towards Locke)*</font>

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Points at his throat)*</font>

Henry Adams: You can’t talk?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Nods)*</font>

Henry Adams: Well, that doesn’t affect your drinking habits, does it?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Smiles)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Pats Locke on the shoulder, leading him to a table)*</font> <font color=grey>*(To manager)*</font> Then perhaps you’ll be kind enough to lead the way for us.

Narrator: Adams learns that the dumb man works in a circus, and invites him to have a meal. He then talks about the million-pound bank note he received from the brothers, and their promise to grant him any job he requests.

Henry Adams: All I was doing was walking around looking for a job, and now look what’s happening. I didn’t ask for this - But now that I’m in it, I may as well enjoy it.

Henry Adams: And that’s where you could come in! Are you very busy these days?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Shakes his head)*</font>

Henry Adams: Well, that’s great! Then why don’t you stay with me for the next four weeks? Help me to keep the bank note intact?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Holds out his hand)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Shakes hands with Locke)*</font> <font color=grey>*(To Locke, proudly)*</font> For the next month, I’m Henry Adams, the American Millionaire.

### Scene 2. At the American Consulate, Henry Adams walks in, followed by Locke. The Ambassador shakes hands with Henry to greet him.

Actors: Ambassador, Henry Adams, Locke

<font color=grey>*(Locke off the stage)*</font>

Ambassador: <font color=grey>*(Warmly)*</font> But for these newspapers I wouldn’t have known your arrival. Well, how long are you staying?

Henry Adams: Well, that depends er ... indefinitely.

Ambassador: <font color=grey>*(Handing a cigar over to Henry)*</font> You’re in time for the season. Who do you know, Mr. Adams?

Henry Adams: I don’t know anyone except er... two brothers in Belgrave Square - Oliver and Roderick something or other. <font color=grey>*(Hesitating)*</font> You see ... This note of mine ...

Ambassador: Say no more, Mr. Adams. Would a hundred pounds be enough?

Henry Adams: Well, that's awfully good of you, but...

Ambassador: <font color=grey>*(On the phone, immediately)*</font> Bring in a hundred pounds immediately for Mr. Henry Adams, in five-pound notes.

Henry Adams: Oh, thank you very much.

Ambassador: I’m here to help our nationals. Now to get down to more serious matters. I must open a few doors for you.

<font color=grey>*(Henry Adams and the Ambassador leave.)*</font>

## Act 6. Henry was introduced to the upper class.

### Scene 1. At Hampshire house (the Duchess’s residence), guests sitting around a table. Henry walks in.

Actors: Duchess of Cromarty, Portia, Portia’s uncle (and Duke of Cromarty), Henry Adams, Guests 1-3, Narrator

Narrator: Henry Adams is introduced to a party at Hampshire house, the Duchess’s residence.

Crowd: Mr. Henry Adams!

Duchess of Cromarty: How good of you to come, Mr. Adams. This is my husband.

Duke: How do you do? <font color=grey>*(Shakes hands with Henry)*</font>

Duchess: <font color=grey>*(Kindly)*</font> Now this is a very informal occasion. I do hope you're going to enjoy yourself. <font color=grey>*(Off the stage)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(Henry Adams walks over to the Ambassador.)*</font>

Ambassador: If you really wish to understand the British, I suggest a visit to the House of Lords. Would you care to come with me?

Henry Adams: Well, yes indeed. As a matter of fact...

Duchess: <font color=grey>*(Onto the stage, approaches Henry)*</font> Mr. Adams, I am most anxious to introduce you to Mr. Hooker Orr.

<font color=grey>*(Henry Adams follows the Duchess and sees Portia on the way.)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(Duchess leaves.)*</font>

Guest 1: Doris likes to play lawn-tennis, Mr. Adams. We just can't keep her away from the Wimbledon Club.

Guest 2: Do the ladies play lawn-tennis in your country, Mr. Adams?

Henry Adams: Oh yes, indeed.

Guest 3: Now, Mr. Adams, I want you to make the acquaintance of Sir William Collins...
<font color=grey>*(Henry Adams and Guest 3 off the stage)*</font>

Guest 1: A man of character!

Guest 2: We must invite him to lunch!

<font color=grey>*(All the actors off the stage.)*</font>

### Scene 2. Portia and her uncle (Duke of Cromarty) sit by a table talking. Henry and the Duchess stand on the other side of the stage.

Actors: Henry Adams, Portia, Portia’s uncle, Narrator

Portia: Uncle?

Duke: What is it, my dear?

Portia: Mr. Henry Adams. I'd like to meet him.

Duke: Have you succumbed too?

Portia: I merely thought it might be useful to get him interested in Aunt Grace's charity. A millionaire behind us is just what we need.

Duke: Oh, if that's your intention, my dear, I'm with you. I'll do my best.

<font color=grey>*(Portia’s uncle walks towards Henry Adams)*</font>

Duchess: <font color=grey>*(To Henry Adams)*</font> Now you see how hard it is to be a host...

Duke: Now I fear I must drag Mr. Adams away from you. We have a relation who will make my life quite intolerable unless she meets him. <font color=grey>*(Leads Henry away)*</font> This way, Mr. Adams.

<font color=grey>*(Following Portia’s uncle, Henry Adams walks towards Portia. Portia’s uncle off the stage.)*</font>

Portia: Won't you sit down?

Henry Adams: Thank you. <font color=grey>*(Sits down.)*</font>

Portia: Poor uncle, he hates my aunt's parties almost as much as I do. Nothing but talk, talk, talk. And nobody says anything, do they?

Henry Adams: Well, nothing very serious. But - when we get back in, won't there be any gossip?

Portia: I'll tell you what we do. We'll say we were discussing the Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

Henry Adams: The what?

Portia: The Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

Henry Adams: Oh, they won't be satisfied with that.

Portia: Oh, they would. It's my aunt's pet charity. And you're a millionaire, after all. They'd expect you to take an interest in charity. You do, don't you?

Henry Adams: Well, yes, I-I do, but...

Portia: And to prove it, you could say you're coming to the opening of our new premises. It's on next Wednesday.

Henry Adams: Uh ... would you be there?

Portia: Of course.

Henry Adams: I'd be there.

<font color=grey>*(Henry and Portia off the stage.)*</font>

Narrator: Henry is invited to the Home for Motherless Babies. After taking a look at the babies, he is taken to a charity auction. He doesn't want to donate much, but is urged by the audience to donate five thousand pounds.

## Act 7. Henry got tired and wanted to leave.

Actors: Henry Adams, Locke

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Talking in his dream)*</font> Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Can't pay. Can't pay. Oh, can't pay... <font color=grey>*(Waking up with a start)*</font> Locke? <font color=grey>*(Sitting up, yelling)*</font> Locke! Locke!

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Entering Henry's room, turning on the lights hurriedly)*</font>

Henry Adams: I can't go on with this, Locke. Not for another day!

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Walking towards Henry, worried)*</font>

Henry Adams: We're overloaded with dept and we're getting deeper every minute. It's like walking on sand. How much of the Ambassador's money do we have left?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Signals “none” to Henry)*</font>

Henry Adams: All gone? The charities?

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Nods his head)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Covering face with hands)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Resignedly)*</font> It costs money to be a millionaire. W-well, we've got to clear out of here somehow. <font color=grey>*(Firmly)*</font> We'll go into hiding until the end of the month. We have to go somewhere, I don't care where, just so we go. You fix it.

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Walks away, perplexed)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Lying down, relieved)*</font> Oh, that's a load off my mind. From now on the masquerade is over.

Locke: <font color=grey>*(Turns the lights off, off the stage)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(The next morning. Locke and Henry wake up and stand by the window)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Sound of birds singing)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(With surprise)*</font> Locke, look. Listen. Smell.

<font color=grey>*(Locke onto the stage, standing beside Henry)*</font>

Henry Adams: <font color=grey>*(Cheerfully)*</font> Locke! We're not going. <font color=grey>*(Tapping Locke on the shoulder)*</font> Things always look bad at night. But in the morning the sun is shining and the birds are singing. We can't throw in the cards like this when the game is only halfway through.

<font color=grey>*(Henry and Locke off the stage.)*</font>

## Act 8. Henry's fame started to influence the stockings of the gold mine.

### Scene 1. In the evening, on the coach and at Bumble Hotel.

Actors: Henry Adams, Lloyd, Coachman, Narrator

<font color=grey>*(Lloyd and Henry are sitting on a coach, and the coachman is driving.)*</font>

Narrator: Henry has just professed his love to Portia at Hampshire House. Now a friend of Henry's, Lloyd Hastings, comes to visit him, and they are on the way to Bumble Hotel.

Lloyd: Now, Henry, you've got to help me. I'm in trouble, and you'll be able to get me out quite easily. I've made a large investment in a gold mine, the Good Hope Gold Mine.

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Daydreaming)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Contentedly)*</font> Oh, what an unforgettable night I had with her. I took the dearest girl in this world - prisoner! It’s the only thing that makes me feel like a man. I tried to tell her the truth - that the bank note didn’t belong to me - but she looked so lovely under the moonlight, I just couldn’t say it.

Narrator: Henry is daydreaming about the time he had with Portia, not listening to Lloyd.

Coachman: Bumble, sir. We're here, sir.

Henry: Well, we're here. Home already. Come on in and have a drink.

<font color=grey>*(Henry and Lloyd enter the hotel and sit down in their room (a table on the other side of the stage))*</font> <font color=grey>*(Coachman leaves)*</font>

Lloyd: Dear me! It's a palace - it's just a palace! Henry, it doesn't merely make me realize how rich you are; it makes me realize, to the bone, to the marrow, how poor I am! Henry, the mere unconsidered drippings of your daily income would -

Henry: Oh, my daily income! Here, down with this hot Scotch, and cheer up your soul. Here's with you! <font color=grey>*(Pours Scotch)*</font> Now, then, Lloyd, unreel your story.

Lloyd: Unreel it? Again? I've already told you about it, Henry. I've sunk everything I have into that mine. But there isn't one capitalist who'll take a chance. <font color=grey>*(Jumping up)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Desperately)*</font> Henry, you can save me! You can save me, and you're the only man in the universe that can. Will you do it? Won't you do it?

Henry: Tell me how. Speak out, my boy.

Lloyd: Give me a million for the marketing rights of the mine! <font color=grey>*(Nervously)*</font> Don't, don't refuse!

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Worriedly, for he knows himself that not a penny of the million pounds belongs to himself)*</font> But- <font color=grey>*(Trying to be calm)*</font> I will save you, Lloyd-

Lloyd: Then I'm already saved! God be merciful to you forever! If ever I-

Henry: <font color=grey>*(In a commercial manner)*</font> Let me finish, Lloyd. I will save you, but not in that way; for that would not be fair to you, after your hard work, and the risks you've run. I don't need to buy mines; I can keep my capital moving, in a commercial center like London, without that. Here’s what I'll do. I know all about that mine, of course; I know its immense value, and can swear to it if anybody wishes it. You shall sell it within two weeks, for three millions cash. Use my name freely, and we'll divide, share and share alike.

Lloyd: <font color=grey>*(Excitedly)*</font> I may use your name! Your name - think of it! Man, they'll flock in droves, these rich Londoners; they'll fight for that stock! I'm a made man, I'm a made man forever, and I'll never forget you as long as I live!

<font color=grey>*(Lloyd and Henry off the stage.)*</font>

### Scene 2. Henry and Portia are on vacation, rowing a boat.

Actors: Henry Adams, Portia, Narrator

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Contentedly)*</font>I've finally won your heart.

Portia: <font color=grey>*(Obediently)*</font>Yes, Henry.

Henry: So you've got to listen to me.

Portia: Yes, Henry.

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Seriously)*</font> Listen, Portia. I'm not a millionaire. The banknote doesn't belong to me. In fact, I don't have a single possession I can call my own.

Portia: Oh, my poor, poor lamb.

Henry: No, I'm serious.

Portia: <font color=grey>*(Suspiciously)*</font> So you’re living in the Bridal suite at Bumbles free of charge?

Henry: That’s right.

Portia: And it costs you nothing to eat or drink?

Henry: That’s right.

Portia: <font color=grey>*(Annoyed)*</font> You really expect me to believe you?

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Embarrassed)*</font> Well, when you hear how the whole thing happened you will. You see...

Portia: <font color=grey>*(Angrily)*</font> Now I think it's time to stop teasing. You can take me home.

Henry: But don't you want to hear how it happened?

Portia: I've heard quite enough. Take me home. And if you're trying to get out of the five thousand pounds you promised my aunt, you may as well know that I shall never marry a man who isn't charitable. <font color=grey>*(Climbs out of the boat.)*</font>

Henry: <font color=grey>*(Chasing Portia)*</font> But wait...

Narrator: Henry then tells Portia the whole story, and Portia is satisfied again.

<font color=grey>*(All actors off the stage.)*</font>
