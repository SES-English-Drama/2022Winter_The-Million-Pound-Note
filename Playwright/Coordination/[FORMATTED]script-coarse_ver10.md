## Act 1. Henry got the cheque by chance.

Actors: Narrator, Henry Adams, Oliver and Roderick Montpelier, Mr. Garrat, Montpelier's butler

### Scene 1.

---

Stage Properties:

1. An A4 paper (the one-million-pound note)
2. A sofa <font color=grey>*(Two beanbags can be an alternative to this if you think a sofa is too heavy and inconvenient to transport)*</font>
3. A chair opposite the sofa

---

<font color=orange>*(Lights off,</font><font color=grey> O.M. and R.M sitting on the sofa on the stage already)*</font>

N: Once upon time when Britain was very rich, deep in the vaults of the Bank of England, there was more gold than anywhere else in the world.

<font color=orange>*(Lights on,</font><font color=grey> Mr. G onto the stage, with the one-million-pound note on his hand)*</font>

Mr. G: Here it is, Mr Montpelier. I‘m sure you will not be disappointed with its prosaic design.

<font color=grey>*(*R.M and O.M. standing up*)*</font>

R.M.: <font color=grey>*(*very naturally answering*)*</font> Oh on the contrary it seems to me a thing of beauty. It looks good. It feels good. It is good.

O.M.: And there is only one other like it, issued in connection with a foreign loan.

R.M.: Yes, we've read about it. That's what gave us the idea.

Mr. G: The idea?

O.M.: I suppose it does seem a little curious that we should need such a large sum in the form of one note. It certainly IS an unusual request.

Mr. G: I imagine it's for business transaction, isn't it?

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(burst out laughing)*</font> Oh business transaction! Very important business, isn't it? Shall we tell Mr. Garrat, Roderick?

R.M.: You leave me no alternative. You see, Mr. Garrat, my brother and I require this pretty exquisite unique little scrap of paper...... for a bet.

Mr. G: A bet? Oh gentlemen, you astonish me. I am astonished at the purpose for which you require this note. I am astonished that you should call it...... a scrap of paper <font color=grey>*(very confused)*</font>. Allow me to draw your attention to the text. I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of one million pounds.

<font color=orange>*(Lights out,</font><font color=grey> Mr. G off the stage, H.A. onto the stage, putting his hands in his pocket, and, R.M. and O.M. standing up, getting onto the balcony)*</font>

### Scene 2.

Stage Properties:

1. A letter
2. A sofa
3. A chair opposite the sofa
4. A cube-shaped box <font color=grey>*(served as a safe)*</font> (The letter is first put in it.)

---

<font color=orange>*(One light on,</font><font color=grey> on H.A. H.A should be walking slowly on the stage, feeling down.)*</font>

N: Henry Adams is wandering on the street. He is quite upset and unsure about his future. But why is he so worried? You will see it right away.

<font color=orange>*(All lights on)*</font>

R.M. : Young man. Would you step inside for a moment, please?

H.A. : <font color=grey>*(looking back and seeing the R.M. and O.M., frowning)*</font> Who? Me, sir?

R.M.: Yes you.

O.M.: Through the front door, on your left.

H.A.: Thanks.

M.b.: Good morning, sir. Will you please come in? Permit me to lead the way, sir. <font color=grey>*(M.b. with H.A. into Montpelier's room)*</font>

O.M.: Thank you, James. That will be all. <font color=grey>*(M.b. off the stage)*</font> How do you do, Mr. er...

H.A. Adams. Henry Adams.

R.M.: Come and sit down, Mr. Adams.

H.A. : <font color=grey>*(sitting onto the chair)*</font> Thank you.

R.M.: You're an American, Mr. Adams?

H.A.: That's right. From New England.

R.M.: How well do you know London?

H.A. Well <font color=grey>*(in affirmative tone)*</font>, er...... I mean, I know nothing. It's my first trip here.

O.M.: I wonder, Mr. Adams, if you'd mind asking a few questions.

H.A. : Go ahead.

O.M.: May we ask what you are doing in this country and what your plans ...

H.A.: Well, I can't say I have any plans. I'm hoping to find work. As a matter of fact I landed in Britain by accident.

O.M.: Oh, how is that possible?

H.A.: Er, you see, back home I have my own little cutter. She's just a fourteen footer but I get a lot of fun out of her. Well, four weeks ago last Saturday I was sailing out of the bay. Towards dusk I found myself in the thick of a westerly gale. I did the only thing I could and ran before it all night. Next morning I'd just about given myself up for being lost when I was spotted by a brig. I earned my passage by working as an unpaid hand, which, er, accounts for my somewhat disreputable appearance.

R.M.: <font color=grey>*(considering)*</font> Hmm, it's a positive advantage.

O.M.: Tell us, Mr. Adams, what sort of work were you engaged in?

H.A.: I had a job with a shipbuilding firm. <font color=grey>*(pause for a second, then eagerly)*</font> Would you be right in thinking that you two might be able to offer me some kind of work?

O.M.: Patience, Mr. Adams. Patience!

R.M.: If it's not an indelicate question - have you any money?

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(very unhappily)*</font> Well, to tell you the truth, my bank roll is ... zero.

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(can't help cheering)*</font> Oh! Perperperperperfect! What a good luck we have, Roderick!

H.A.: (a bit angry now) It may seem lucky to you gentlemen, but it's not very lucky to me! Now, if you excuse me, I'll be on my way. <font color=grey>*(getting up, wanting to leave)*</font>

R.M.: Oh, please don't go, Mr. Adams. You mustn't think we're insensitive. I'm sorry for my brother's tactlessness. Oliver, give him the letter.

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(standing up, reaching from the safe)*</font> I was about to say the same thing myself. <font color=grey>*(taking out the letter from the safe, handing it to H.A.)*</font> The letter.

<font color=green>*(Creepy music)*</font>

H.A.: For me? <font color=grey>*(not understanding why, yet accepting it)*</font>

R.M.:Yes. FOR YOU.

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(looking at O.M. and R.M. with great suspicion and reading)*</font>The enclosed Bank Note is lent to you for one month. If you return it intact at the end of that time, you shall have any job that is within our power to give you. It may interest you to know that we have a bet on you... Oh, excuse me, sir. I suppose there must be something wrong. It's a one-million-pound note. That is ridiculous.

O.M.: It is NOT ridiculous.  We appreciate your honesty, Mr. Adams. That's why we've given YOU the letter. James, show Mr. Adams out. Wish you good luck.

*(M.b. onto the stage, seeing M.b. into the room, H.A. standing up)*

H.A.: Wait. But why...?

*(O.M. and R.M. standing up too)*

R.M.: Mr. Adams! <font color=grey>*(pause for a while, then with a smile)*</font> Wish you good luck.

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(slightly sighing)*</font> Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

<font color=grey>*(H.A. and M.b. off the stage, </font><font color=orange>all lights out, R.M. and O.M. off the stage)*</font>

N: Now our lucky dog Henry, who has no choice but accept the fact that he IS a millionaire, steps into a clothes shop. As you see, his clothes isn't very decent, and he really needs ready-made suits.

<font color=orange>*(Lights on.</font><font color=grey> H.A. with his one-million-pound note, C.S.S.1, C.S.S.M and C.S.S.2 onto the stage)*</font>

C.S.M: Tell Tod to serve him quickly and get him out of the side door.

C.S.S.2: Yes, sir.
*(</font><font color=grey> C.S.S.2 walking to the other side of the stage)*</font>

H.A.: Is this the sort of thing that's worn in England?

C.S.S.1: Oh yes, sir. It's all the fashion. Try the trousers.

C.S.S.2: <font color=grey>*(whispering to C.S.S.1, but loud enough for the audience to hear)*</font> Mr. Reid says you've got to get him out of the side entrance and be quick.

C.S.S.1: I know what I'm doing. I've got eyes, haven't I?

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(interrupting)*</font> Er... excuse me, sir. I'm so sorry to remind you that you are all wearing microphones, so not only I but also all the students in the auditorium can hear what you say...

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 & C.S.S.2 slowly turning around to look at each other, very nervous and not knowing what to do next. BGM: very very embarrassed)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(pause for two seconds)*</font>

C.S.S.2: Er... <font color=grey>*(whispering to C.S.S.1, but still loud enough for the audience to hear)*</font> Tod, do you remember what we were talking about? I forgot my script! Our playwrights write so many lines for me!

C.S.S.1: Ah. We were talking about the suit. You said this genteleman is a little difficult for size.

H.A.: Well, it'll do for the time being. I'll take it. Oh, er... If you don't mind I'd.... I'd like to open an account and settle with you in a month. You see, I, er..., don't happen to have any small change.

C.S.S.2: <font color=grey>*(very enigmatically and with utter disdain)*</font> Ha, I suppose a gentlman like you can only be expected to carry large change.

H.A.: 'Cause I've only got a bank note. One million pounds. <font color=grey>*(very enigmatically)*</font> YOU CAN CHARGE IT, can't you?

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 & C.S.S.2 slowly turning around to look at each other, again very nervous and not knowing what to do next. BGM: very very embarrassed)*</font>

C.S.S.1: <font color=grey>*(very embarrassing)*</font> Er... I'm sorry, sir. Allow me to go get our manager over.

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 moving to the other side of the stage, then C.S.S.1 and C.S.M going back)*</font>

N: Tod reports the situation to the manager.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(as if seeing a piece of gold)*</font> Would it be the one I saw in the papers on Wednesday or was it Thursday? Oh, I remember thinking that never would I be blessed with the feel of such a note as this. <font color=grey>*(suddenly loudly and angrily, to C.S.S.1)*</font> You idiot, Tod! A born idiot! Bring the gentleman into this part of the shop! <font color=grey>*(very adulatorily and politely)*</font> You'd think we never had dealing with millionaires. Oh! Take off this jacket, sir, it only fit for the dustbin <font color=grey>*(H.A. taking off his jacket)*</font>. <font color=grey>*(suddenly loudly and angrily to C.S.S.1)*</font> Hey you stupid donkey! Get Jack, Arthur and William. Be quick! <font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 running off the stage, suddenly very very sycophantly and politely)*</font> Allow me sir. Er... this way, sir.

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.2 showing Henry his second costume in this play, which he will put on later)*</font>

C.S.M: Yes. Yes. <font color=grey>*(obsequiously)*</font> First thing in the morning, we shall start to make for you. You'll be needing a morning suit, a dress suit, something for opera. You'll never get through the season without them. Thirty suits is the very minimum. Now what about a cycling suit, Mr. Adams? Cycling is all the rage nowadays. Then of course...

H.A.: No, no, no. I don't need so many suits. And I can't give you all those orders 'cause you'd have to wait indefinitely for payment.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(acting surprise)*</font> Indefinitely! A weak word. Eternally, Mr. Adams! It's our pride and glory to see a man of your eminence properly attired for the season. To skimp it would be inconvenient to you and harmful to me. Ah! Your suit will be ready for you in the morning...

H.A.: That's fine. I'll just get back into these now.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(very horrored)*</font> No! Oh dear, oh dear, the humiliation!

H.A.: Still, I suppose there's no alternative.

C.S.M: Your address, Mr. Adams?

H.A.: Oh, I don't have an address. I'm changing quarters.

C.S.M: Take my advice and stay at Bumbles.

H.A.: Bumbles?

C.S.M: The very place, quiet, modest and discretion itself. <font color=grey>*(with a very very sycophantic smile)*</font> Luckily for you I have a relative on the management. Leave it to me.

<font color=orange>*(All lights out, everyone off the stage)*</font>

N.: The hotel staff has mistaken Lloyd, a dumb man with shocking strength, for Adams. Lloyd was reluctant to leave, and the hotel staff decides to call the police.

R.bum: <font color=grey>*(Leads Rock away)*</font>

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Knocks receptionist down)*</font>

H.A.: Just a minute. I don’t think we need the police. I’d like to have a talk with this gentleman. <font color=grey>*(Walks towards Rock)*</font>

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Points at his throat)*</font>

H.A.: You can’t talk?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Nods)*</font>

H.A.: Well, that doesn’t affect your drinking habits, does it?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Smiles)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Pats Rock on the shoulder, leading him to a table)*</font> <font color=grey>*(To manager)*</font> Then perhaps you’ll be kind enough to lead the way for us.

N.: Adams learns that the dumb man works in a circus, and invites him to have a meal. He then talks about the million-pound bank note he received from the brothers, and their promise to grant him any job he requests.

H.A.: All I was doing was walking around looking for a job, and now look what’s happening. I didn’t ask for this - But now that I’m in it, I may as well enjoy it.

H.A.: And that’s where you could come in! Are you very busy these days?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Shakes his head)*</font>

H.A.: Well, that’s great! Then why don’t you stay with me for the next four weeks? Help me to keep the bank note intact?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Holds out his hand)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Shakes hands with Rock)*</font> <font color=grey>*(To Rock, proudly)*</font> For the next month, I’m H.A., the American Millionaire.

<font color=grey>*(In the background, reading the name aloud)*</font> Mr. Henry Adams!

Duch: How good of you to come, Mr. Adams. This is my husband.

Duke: How do you do? <font color=grey>*(Shakes hands with Henry)*</font>

Duch: <font color=grey>*(Kindly)*</font> Now this is a very informal occasion. I do hope you're going to enjoy yourself. <font color=grey>*(Off the stage)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(Guest 4 onto the stage, walking over to Henry.)*</font>

Guest 4: If you really wish to understand the British, I suggest a visit to the House of Lords. Would you care to come with me?

H.A.: Well, yes indeed. As a matter of fact...

<font color=grey>*(Guest 4 off the stage)*</font>

Duch: <font color=grey>*(Onto the stage, approaches Henry)*</font> Mr. Adams, I am most anxious to introduce you to Mr. Hooker Orr.

<font color=grey>*(H.A. follows the Duchess and walks pass P.L., when she and Henry look at each other, and both of them start smiling involuntarily)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(Duchess leaves.)*</font>

Guest 1: Doris likes to play lawn-tennis, Mr. Adams. We just can't keep her away from the Wimbledon Club.

Duke: What is it, my dear?

P.L.: Mr. Henry Adams. I'd like to meet him.

Duke: Have you succumbed too?

P.L.: I merely thought it might be useful to get him interested in Aunt Grace's charity. A millionaire behind us is just what we need.

Duke: Oh, if that's your intention, my dear, I'm with you. I'll do my best.

<font color=grey>*(P.L.’s uncle walks towards H.A.)*</font>

Duch: <font color=grey>*(To H.A.)*</font> Now you see how hard it is to be a host...

Duke: Now I fear I must drag Mr. Adams away from you. We have a relation who will make my life quite intolerable unless she meets him. <font color=grey>*(Leads Henry away)*</font> This way, Mr. Adams.

<font color=grey>*(Following P.L.’s uncle, H.A. walks towards P.L.. P.L.’s uncle off the stage.)*</font>

P.L.: Won't you sit down?

H.A.: Thank you. <font color=grey>*(Sits down.)*</font>

P.L.: Poor uncle, he hates my aunt's parties almost as much as I do. Nothing but talk, talk, talk. And nobody says anything, do they?

H.A.: Well, nothing very serious. But - when we get back in, won't there be any gossip?

P.L.: I'll tell you what we do. We'll say we were discussing the Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

H.A.: The what?

P.L.: The Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

H.A.: Oh, they won't be satisfied with that.

P.L.: Oh, they would. It's my aunt's pet charity. And you're a millionaire, after all. They'd expect you to take an interest in charity. You do, don't you?

H.A.: Well, yes, I-I do, but...

P.L.: And to prove it, you could say you're coming to the opening of our new premises. It's on next Wednesday.

H.A.: Uh ... would you be there?

P.L.: Of course.

H.A.: I'd be there.

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Entering Henry's room, turning on the lights hurriedly)*</font>

H.A.: I can't go on with this, Locke. Not for another day!

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Walking towards Henry, worried)*</font>

H.A.: We're overloaded with dept and we're getting deeper every minute. It's like walking on sand. How much of the Ambassador's money do we have left?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Signals "none" to Henry)*</font>

H.A.: All gone? The charities?

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Nods his head)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Covering face with hands)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Resignedly)*</font> It costs money to be a millionaire. W-well, we've got to clear out of here somehow. <font color=grey>*(Firmly)*</font> We'll go into hiding until the end of the month. We have to go somewhere, I don't care where, just so we go. You fix it.

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Walks away, perplexed)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Lying down, relieved)*</font> Oh, that's a load off my mind. From now on the masquerade is over.

Rock: <font color=grey>*(Turns the lights off, off the stage)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(The next morning. Rock and Henry wake up and stand by the window)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Sound of birds singing)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(With surprise)*</font> Locke, look. Listen. Smell.

<font color=grey>*(Rock onto the stage, standing beside Henry)*</font>

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Cheerfully)*</font> Locke! We're not going. <font color=grey>*(Tapping Rock on the shoulder)*</font> Things always look bad at night. But in the morning the sun is shining and the birds are singing. We can't throw in the cards like this when the game is only halfway through.

N.: Henry has just professed his love to Portia at Hampshire House. Now a friend of Henry's, Lloyd, comes to visit him, and they are on the way to Bumble Hotel.

Mr.H.: Now, Henry, you've got to help me. I'm in trouble, and you'll be able to get me out quite easily. I've made a large investment in a gold mine, the Good Hope Gold Mine.

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Daydreaming)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Contentedly)*</font> Oh, what an unforgettable night I had with her. I won the heart of the dearest girl in this world! When I told her - I did, indeed - told her I loved her, she - well, she blushed till her hair turned red, but she liked it; she said she did. And she’s the only person I could be perfectly honest and square with. I told her I hadn't a cent in the world but just the million-pound note, and it didn't belong to me. I told her the whole story. She couldn’t believe it at first - but then she just laughed. She didn’t seem to mind it at all...

**(Note that this should be addressed to the audience)**

N.: Henry Adams is daydreaming about the time he had with Portia, not listening to Lloyd.

<font color=grey>*(Background, as the driver reminding
the passengers)*</font> Bumble, sir. We're here, sir.

H.A.: Well, we're here. Home already. Come on in and have a drink.

<font color=grey>*(H.A. and Mr.H. enter the hotel and sit down in their room (represented with a table))*</font>

Mr.H.: Dear me! It's a palace - it's just a palace! Henry Adams, it doesn't merely make me realize how rich you are; it makes me realize, to the bone, to the marrow, how poor I am! Henry Adams, the mere unconsidered drippings of your daily income would -

H.A.: Oh, my daily income! Here, down with this hot Scotch, and cheer up your soul. Here's with you! <font color=grey>*(Pours Scotch)*</font> Now, then, Lloyd, unreel your story.

Mr.H.: Unreel it? Once more? I've already told you about it, Henry Adams. I've sunk everything I have into that mine. But there isn't one capitalist who'll take a chance. <font color=grey>*(Jumping up)*</font> <font color=grey>*(Desperately)*</font> Henry Adams, you can save me! You can save me, and you're the only man in the universe that can. Will you do it? Won't you do it?

H.A.: Tell me how. Speak out, my boy.

Mr.H.: Give me a million for the marketing rights of the mine! <font color=grey>*(Nervously)*</font> Don't, don't refuse!

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(Worriedly, for he knows himself that not a penny of the million pounds belongs to himself)*</font> But- <font color=grey>*(Trying to be calm)*</font> I will save you, Lloyd-

Mr.H.: Then I'm already saved! God be merciful to you forever! If ever I-

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(In a commercial manner)*</font> Let me finish, Lloyd. I will save you, but not in that way; for that would not be fair to you, after your hard work, and the risks you've run. I don't need to buy mines; I can keep my capital moving, in a commercial center like London. Here’s what I'll do. I know all about that mine, of course; I know its immense value, and can swear to it if anybody wishes it. You shall sell it within two weeks, for three millions cash. Use my name freely, and we'll divide the profits.

Mr.H.: <font color=grey>*(Excitedly)*</font> I may use your name! Your name - think of it! Man, they'll flock in droves, these rich Londoners; they'll fight for that stock! I'm a made man, I'm a made man forever, and I'll never forget you as long as I live!

<font color=grey>*(Mr.H. and H.A. off the stage.)*</font>
