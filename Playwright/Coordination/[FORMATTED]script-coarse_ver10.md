## Act 1. Henry got the cheque by chance.

Actors: Narrator, Henry Adams, Oliver and Roderick Montpelier, Mr. Garrat, Montpelier's butler

### Scene 1.

---

Stage Properties:

1. An A4 paper (the one-million-pound note)
2. A sofa <font color=grey>*(Two beanbags can be an alternative to this if you think a sofa is too heavy and inconvenient to transport)*</font>
3. A chair opposite the sofa

---

<font color=orange>*(Lights off,</font><font color=grey> O.M. and R.M sitting on the sofa on the stage already)*</font>

N: Once upon time when Britain was very rich, deep in the vaults of the Bank of England, there was more gold than anywhere else in the world.

<font color=orange>*(Lights on,</font><font color=grey> Mr. G onto the stage, with the one-million-pound note on his hand)*</font>

Mr. G: Here it is, Mr Montpelier. I‘m sure you will not be disappointed with its prosaic design.

<font color=grey>*(*R.M and O.M. standing up*)*</font>

R.M.: <font color=grey>*(*very naturally answering*)*</font> Oh on the contrary it seems to me a thing of beauty. It looks good. It feels good. It is good.

O.M.: And there is only one other like it, issued in connection with a foreign loan.

R.M.: Yes, we've read about it. That's what gave us the idea.

Mr. G: The idea?

O.M.: I suppose it does seem a little curious that we should need such a large sum in the form of one note. It certainly IS an unusual request.

Mr. G: I imagine it's for business transaction, isn't it?

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(burst out laughing)*</font> Oh business transaction! Very important business, isn't it? Shall we tell Mr. Garrat, Roderick?

R.M.: You leave me no alternative. You see, Mr. Garrat, my brother and I require this pretty exquisite unique little scrap of paper...... for a bet.

Mr. G: A bet? Oh gentlemen, you astonish me. I am astonished at the purpose for which you require this note. I am astonished that you should call it...... a scrap of paper <font color=grey>*(very confused)*</font>. Allow me to draw your attention to the text. I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of one million pounds.

<font color=orange>*(Lights out,</font><font color=grey> Mr. G off the stage, H.A. onto the stage, putting his hands in his pocket, and, R.M. and O.M. standing up, getting onto the balcony)*</font>

### Scene 2.

---

Stage Properties:

1. A letter
2. A sofa
3. A chair opposite the sofa
4. A cube-shaped box <font color=grey>*(served as a safe)*</font> (The letter is first put in it.)

---

<font color=orange>*(One light on,</font><font color=grey> on H.A. H.A should be walking slowly on the stage, feeling down.)*</font>

N: Henry Adams is wandering on the street. He is quite upset and unsure about his future. But why is he so worried? You will see it right away.

<font color=orange>*(All lights on)*</font>

R.M. : Young man. Would you step inside for a moment, please?

H.A. : <font color=grey>*(looking back and seeing the R.M. and O.M., frowning)*</font> Who? Me, sir?

R.M.: Yes you.

O.M.: Through the front door, on your left.

H.A.: Thanks.

M.b.: Good morning, sir. Will you please come in? Permit me to lead the way, sir. <font color=grey>*(M.b. with H.A. into Montpelier's room)*</font>

O.M.: Thank you, James. That will be all. <font color=grey>*(M.b. off the stage)*</font> How do you do, Mr. er...

H.A. Adams. Henry Adams.

R.M.: Come and sit down, Mr. Adams.

H.A. : <font color=grey>*(sitting onto the chair)*</font> Thank you.

R.M.: You're an American, Mr. Adams?

H.A.: That's right. From New England.

R.M.: How well do you know London?

H.A. Well <font color=grey>*(in affirmative tone)*</font>, er...... I mean, I know nothing. It's my first trip here.

O.M.: I wonder, Mr. Adams, if you'd mind asking a few questions.

H.A. : Go ahead.

O.M.: May we ask what you are doing in this country and what your plans ...

H.A.: Well, I can't say I have any plans. I'm hoping to find work. As a matter of fact I landed in Britain by accident.

O.M.: Oh, how is that possible?

H.A.: Er, you see, back home I have my own little cutter. She's just a fourteen footer but I get a lot of fun out of her. Well, four weeks ago last Saturday I was sailing out of the bay. Towards dusk I found myself in the thick of a westerly gale. I did the only thing I could and ran before it all night. Next morning I'd just about given myself up for being lost when I was spotted by a brig. I earned my passage by working as an unpaid hand, which, er, accounts for my somewhat disreputable appearance.

R.M.: <font color=grey>*(considering)*</font> Hmm, it's a positive advantage.

O.M.: Tell us, Mr. Adams, what sort of work were you engaged in?

H.A.: I had a job with a shipbuilding firm. <font color=grey>*(pause for a second, then eagerly)*</font> Would you be right in thinking that you two might be able to offer me some kind of work?

O.M.: Patience, Mr. Adams. Patience!

R.M.: If it's not an indelicate question - have you any money?

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(very unhappily)*</font> Well, to tell you the truth, my bank roll is ... zero.

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(can't help cheering)*</font> Oh! Perperperperperfect! What a good luck we have, Roderick!

H.A.: (a bit angry now) It may seem lucky to you gentlemen, but it's not very lucky to me! Now, if you excuse me, I'll be on my way. <font color=grey>*(getting up, wanting to leave)*</font>

R.M.: Oh, please don't go, Mr. Adams. You mustn't think we're insensitive. I'm sorry for my brother's tactlessness. Oliver, give him the letter.

O.M.: <font color=grey>*(standing up, reaching from the safe)*</font> I was about to say the same thing myself. <font color=grey>*(taking out the letter from the safe, handing it to H.A.)*</font> The letter.

<font color=green>*(Creepy music)*</font>

H.A.: For me? <font color=grey>*(not understanding why, yet accepting it)*</font>

R.M.:Yes. FOR YOU.

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(looking at O.M. and R.M. with great suspicion and reading)*</font>The enclosed Bank Note is lent to you for one month. If you return it intact at the end of that time, you shall have any job that is within our power to give you. It may interest you to know that we have a bet on you... Oh, excuse me, sir. I suppose there must be something wrong. It's a one-million-pound note. That is ridiculous.

O.M.: It is NOT ridiculous.  We appreciate your honesty, Mr. Adams. That's why we've given YOU the letter. James, show Mr. Adams out. Wish you good luck.

*(M.b. onto the stage, seeing M.b. into the room, H.A. standing up)*

H.A.: Wait. But why...?

*(O.M. and R.M. standing up too)*

R.M.: Mr. Adams! <font color=grey>*(pause for a while, then with a smile)*</font> Wish you good luck.

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(slightly sighing)*</font> Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

<font color=grey>*(H.A. and M.b. off the stage, </font><font color=orange>all lights out, R.M. and O.M. off the stage)*</font>

N: Now our lucky dog Henry, who has no choice but accept the fact that he IS a millionaire, steps into a clothes shop. As you see, his clothes isn't very decent, and he really needs ready-made suits.

<font color=orange>*(Lights on.</font><font color=grey> H.A. with his one-million-pound note, C.S.S.1, C.S.S.M and C.S.S.2 onto the stage)*</font>

C.S.M: Tell Tod to serve him quickly and get him out of the side door.

C.S.S.2: Yes, sir.
*(</font><font color=grey> C.S.S.2 walking to the other side of the stage)*</font>

H.A.: Is this the sort of thing that's worn in England?

C.S.S.1: Oh yes, sir. It's all the fashion. Try the trousers.

C.S.S.2: <font color=grey>*(whispering to C.S.S.1, but loud enough for the audience to hear)*</font> Mr. Reid says you've got to get him out of the side entrance and be quick.

C.S.S.1: I know what I'm doing. I've got eyes, haven't I?

H.A.: <font color=grey>*(interrupting)*</font> Er... excuse me, sir. I'm so sorry to remind you that you are all wearing microphones, so not only I but also all the students in the auditorium can hear what you say...

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 & C.S.S.2 slowly turning around to look at each other, very nervous and not knowing what to do next. BGM: very very embarrassed)*</font>

<font color=grey>*(pause for two seconds)*</font>

C.S.S.2: Er... <font color=grey>*(whispering to C.S.S.1, but still loud enough for the audience to hear)*</font> Tod, do you remember what we were talking about? I forgot my script! Our playwrights write so many lines for me!

C.S.S.1: Ah. We were talking about the suit. You said this genteleman is a little difficult for size.

H.A.: Well, it'll do for the time being. I'll take it. Oh, er... If you don't mind I'd.... I'd like to open an account and settle with you in a month. You see, I, er..., don't happen to have any small change.

C.S.S.2: <font color=grey>*(very enigmatically and with utter disdain)*</font> Ha, I suppose a gentlman like you can only be expected to carry large change.

H.A.: 'Cause I've only got a bank note. One million pounds. <font color=grey>*(very enigmatically)*</font> YOU CAN CHARGE IT, can't you?

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 & C.S.S.2 slowly turning around to look at each other, again very nervous and not knowing what to do next. BGM: very very embarrassed)*</font>

C.S.S.1: <font color=grey>*(very embarrassing)*</font> Er... I'm sorry, sir. Allow me to go get our manager over.

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 moving to the other side of the stage, then C.S.S.1 and C.S.M going back)*</font>

N: Tod reports the situation to the manager.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(as if seeing a piece of gold)*</font> Would it be the one I saw in the papers on Wednesday or was it Thursday? Oh, I remember thinking that never would I be blessed with the feel of such a note as this. <font color=grey>*(suddenly loudly and angrily, to C.S.S.1)*</font> You idiot, Tod! A born idiot! Bring the gentleman into this part of the shop! <font color=grey>*(very adulatorily and politely)*</font> You'd think we never had dealing with millionaires. Oh! Take off this jacket, sir, it only fit for the dustbin <font color=grey>*(H.A. taking off his jacket)*</font>. <font color=grey>*(suddenly loudly and angrily to C.S.S.1)*</font> Hey you stupid donkey! Get Jack, Arthur and William. Be quick! <font color=grey>*(C.S.S.1 running off the stage, suddenly very very sycophantly and politely)*</font> Allow me sir. Er... this way, sir.

<font color=grey>*(C.S.S.2 showing Henry his second costume in this play, which he will put on later)*</font>

C.S.M: Yes. Yes. <font color=grey>*(obsequiously)*</font> First thing in the morning, we shall start to make for you. You'll be needing a morning suit, a dress suit, something for opera. You'll never get through the season without them. Thirty suits is the very minimum. Now what about a cycling suit, Mr. Adams? Cycling is all the rage nowadays. Then of course...

H.A.: No, no, no. I don't need so many suits. And I can't give you all those orders 'cause you'd have to wait indefinitely for payment.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(acting surprise)*</font> Indefinitely! A weak word. Eternally, Mr. Adams! It's our pride and glory to see a man of your eminence properly attired for the season. To skimp it would be inconvenient to you and harmful to me. Ah! Your suit will be ready for you in the morning...

H.A.: That's fine. I'll just get back into these now.

C.S.M: <font color=grey>*(very horrored)*</font> No! Oh dear, oh dear, the humiliation!

H.A.: Still, I suppose there's no alternative.

C.S.M: Your address, Mr. Adams?

H.A.: Oh, I don't have an address. I'm changing quarters.

C.S.M: Take my advice and stay at Bumbles.

H.A.: Bumbles?

C.S.M: The very place, quiet, modest and discretion itself. <font color=grey>*(with a very very sycophantic smile)*</font> Luckily for you I have a relative on the management. Leave it to me.

<font color=orange>*(All lights out, everyone off the stage)*</font>
