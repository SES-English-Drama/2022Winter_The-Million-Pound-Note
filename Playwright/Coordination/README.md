## Note from Allan on 2022.12.11:

The misuse of version control led to updates on archaic files, thus causing troubles. I hereby briefly explain the discrepencies between [ver7]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver7.md), [ver8]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver8.md), and [ver9]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver9.md):

- Ver 7 was the first draft submitted. Unfortunately, ver 8 and ver 9 haven't been modified based on this version.
- Ver 8 was created by Timmy Wang, who corrected grammatical mistakes and modified abbreviations. This version hasn't taken into account the modifications of ver 7 based on archived versions.
- Ver 9 was created by Tony Zhang and was based on ver 8, and the parts of Tony and Timmy have been corrected.

Therefore, the integrated version, i.e. [ver 10]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver10.md), will be composed based on  [ver7]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver7.md) and [ver9]([FORMATTED]script-coarse_ver9.md).
