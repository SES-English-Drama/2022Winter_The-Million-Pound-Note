## 3. About stage work

1. **Costumes**: Every actor/actress should prepare costumes that suit the character. I'm not an expert, and therefore I would recommend you refer to the movie A Million Pounds (1954) or the original book by Mark Twain.
2. **Crucial role - Stage Supervisor (undetermined)**: We may also need a stage supervisor. He/She is responsible for arranging students to move or remove the stage properties which is large in size.

## 4. Notations

- **[Stage reset]**: The symbol indicates that the stage supervisor and his/her team members should go onto the stage quietly to reset the stage properties. Besides, from my personal point of view, I think the actors should spare some time to watch the movie before they perform on stage. This may help them memorize the script, and help them form a brief understanding of what the play wants to convey.
