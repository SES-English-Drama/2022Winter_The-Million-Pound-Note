P.L.: Won't you sit down?

H.A.: Thank you. <font color=grey>*(Sitting down)*</font>

P.L.: Poor uncle, he hates my aunt's parties almost as much as I do. Nothing but talk, talk, talk. And nobody says anything, do they?

H.A.: Well, nothing very serious. But - when we get back in, won't there be any gossip?

P.L.: I'll tell you what we do. We'll say we were discussing the Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

H.A.: The what?

P.L.: The Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies.

H.A.: Oh, they won't be satisfied with that.

P.L.: Oh, they would. It's my aunt's pet charity. And you're a millionaire, after all. They'd expect you to take an interest in charity. You do, don't you?

H.A.: Well, yes, I-I do, but...

P.L.: And to prove it, you could say you're coming to the opening of our new premises. It's on next Wednesday.

H.A.: Uh ... would you be there?

P.L.: Of course.

H.A.: I'd be there.


## Plan A

P.L.: Great! It's a date then.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> Yes, it's a date.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(giggles)</font> You know, I never thought I'd be talking about charity at one of these parties.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(laughing)</font> Yes, it's quite a change from discussing the stock market and investments.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> I have to admit, I was only interested in your fortunes at first. But now, I'm finding myself more interested in the man behind the money.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> Is that so?

P.L.: <font color=grey>(nodding)</font> Yes, it is. You're quite charming when you're not talking about business.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> Well, I suppose I have to thank the Cromarty Home for Motherless Babies for that.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(giggles)</font> Yes, I suppose you do.

As the night went on, H.A. and P.L. continued to talk and laugh together. They found themselves enjoying each other's company more and more. And as they said goodbye at the end of the night, H.A. knew that he wanted to see P.L. again.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(taking P.L.'s hand)</font> I had a wonderful time tonight. Would you let me take you out to dinner tomorrow night?

P.L.: <font color=grey>(blushing)</font> I'd love that.

And so, H.A. and P.L.'s romance blossomed over charity events and dinner dates. They soon fell deeply in love, and it wasn't long before H.A. proposed to P.L. in a grand romantic gesture involving a hot air balloon ride and a banner that read "Will you marry me?" P.L. said yes, and they lived happily ever after.

## Plan B

P.L.: Then it's settled. We'll be the most charitable couple in the room.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> I never thought charity could be so attractive.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(laughs)</font> You know, I thought you were just another boring rich man at first. But you're actually quite interesting.

H.A.: Oh, really? And what changed your mind?

P.L.: <font color=grey>(playfully)</font> Your money, of course.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(smirks)</font> Ah, so you're just after my fortune?

P.L.: <font color=grey>(teasingly)</font> Maybe at first, but now I'm after your heart.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(leans in closer)</font> Well, you can have it.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(blushes)</font> Oh, you smooth talker.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(grins)</font> And you, my dear, are quite the catch.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(giggles)</font> I can't believe we're flirting at a charity event.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(whispers)</font> It's our little secret.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(smiling)</font> I think I like you, H.A.

H.A.: <font color=grey>(leans in for a kiss)</font> And I think I love you, P.L.

P.L.: <font color=grey>(returns the kiss)</font> You know, I think this is the most exciting charity event I've ever been to.
